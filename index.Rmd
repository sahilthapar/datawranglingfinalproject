### Why Football ?

Football (Soccer) is the most watched and played sport in the world. The [2014 FIFA
World Cup final was viewed by about 3.2 billion people](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=12/news=2014-fifa-world-cuptm-reached-3-2-billion-viewers-one-billion-watched--2745519.html).
European countries have the most followed club football leagues across the world and the English Premier League (EPL) is the most popular one.  

__How leagues work?__

* Each league consists of 20 teams that play 2 games (one at home ground, one at away ground) against every other team in a round-robin fashion i.e. every team plays a total of 38 games in a season.  
* Every win is awarded with 3 points, draw with 1 point and no points are awarded for a loss.  
* The team with the most points at the end of the season wins the league.  
* The bottom 3 teams are replaced by the top-3 finishing teams from the second-tier league.  

Using historical data, I would like to predict the result of games. Prediction of
results is not only advantageous for betting, it can also give you bragging rights
over your friends in [fantasy football](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/).  

I will employ `dplyr` and other [libraries]() to clean up data and build some simple
models to predict the result. The result for every match can be one of the following three

* __Home__: Home team wins
* __Away__: Away team wins
* __Draw__: The game ends in a draw

The data consists of multiple tables. You can find a full description of variables being used [here](docs/data_description.html).

### Insights
* Taller players tend to score more goals

* Wayne Rooney, Sergio Aguero, Robin Van Persie, Frank Lampard stand out as top scorers compared to the number of games they play

* Manchester United is the most successful team over the last 8 years

* Aston Villa allows the most goals. (They were relegated last season)

* Manchester City scores the most goals from penalties.

* Robin Van Persie and Sergio Aguero score the most goals in the first 15 minutes of the game while Frank Lampard is the best player to play the last 15 minutes.

* Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard have both scored 25 goals from the penalty spot.

* Most goals that are not normal shots are either headers or long range goals.
